## About Me  
I hold a Master’s degree in Engineering and a Bachelor’s in Electronic Engineering, with 8 years of experience in video game development (5 years in professional studios and 3 as a freelance developer). I have directed and successfully completed multiple projects using Unity Engine, ranging from video games to interactive experiences.  

Additionally, I have over 5 years of experience teaching programming and video game development, which has allowed me to combine hands-on industry experience with educational principles.  

My portfolio includes Magic Academy (Steam, App Store, Google Play), where I contributed to AI integration and gameplay systems, and ECO (Steam), where I implemented new key features. I have also worked on projects like Papumba Academy (App Store, Google Play) and developed interactive experiences submitted to the Play Store for local events.
